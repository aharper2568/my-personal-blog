# MY PERSONAL BLOG

## Intro
This project is a two-webpage application that allows the user to enter a username, post title, and input content into a text field. The user input is saved and displayed on the secondary page with the choice of multiple entries.

## Features

- Navigation between pages
- Utilization of localStorage
- Button to switch between light mode and dark mode

## Usage 

- On the landing page, there are three input fields titled Username, Blog Title, and Content.
- After filling the three inputs and clicking the submit button, the user is redirected to another webpage that displays the submitted text in sequential order of information given.
- Clicking on the back button on the secondary webpage will bring the user back to the landing page, enabling the option of submitting another blog post.
